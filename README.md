# Selenium Automation Script

This repository contains a Selenium script for automating specific tasks on a web page.

## Description

This project is an automated web scraper designed for a Danish student housing website https://mit.s.dk/. Its primary function is to log into personal accounts and scrape detailed information about all the apartments currently queued for by the user. The scraper retrieves data such as brief descriptions, addresses, room sizes, prices, and current queue rankings of each apartment. This enables users to quickly and efficiently review their position in various student housing options, facilitating informed decision-making.

## FYI:
Quick Overview: The scraper is tailored to provide a quick snapshot of the user's current queue status for various apartments, allowing for a rapid review without manual checks.
Data Extraction: It automatically extracts information from the first listed room of each property. Users interested in more comprehensive details can modify the code to fetch data from all listed rooms.
